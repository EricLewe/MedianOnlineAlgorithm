# MedianOnlineAlgorithm

Simply some problem solvning using heaps and the concept of an online algorithm.
It was really fun using the API made by modular finance!

## Setup
Current repo expects eclipse to be used. You should be able to immediately import this project and run it from the eclipse IDE. 
If that is not wanted, all you need is the main.java file in this repo. Make sure to have the required jar! Else the import of org.json will cause an error in the program.

Source of the jar:
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json
